Windows Script for FiveM

This was made with an old " partner " why he is not partner anymore ?

Here is the story. 

I asked him to give me the ownership of the Discord because I've been working on support and lots of stuff for about a year now. At the first time he say no then he decided to give me the ownership.

A day later when he give me the ownership I'm waiting him to jump in a call 20 minutes later I see that I have no longer access to anything except the discord and my personal stuff. 

After pm him about it he decided to tell me he doesn't want to be in the team anymore because he doesn't have the ownership of it. ( He have youtube, GitHub, Website, VPS, so almost everything important ) 

Few hours passed and I see lots of things first he say that I didn't do anything in XLife and stuff like that, yes i'm not a professional developer, maybe i don't make often some content but i can say something most of the content he made was taken or stolen and i know that only few minutes ago ( I'm writing this the 12/11/2020 at 14:16PM )

He decided to talk about my personal life with other people, most of this friends did came to my pm and injuring me and saying bad stuff, so that's why I'm sharing this.
